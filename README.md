# About
The purpose of this repository is to determine which allocation of investment assets would have been most fruitful in the last century.

Given x amount of USD monthly and using continuous automatic investing, which ratio of stocks, long term treasury bonds, intermediate term treasury bonds, commodities, etc.. would have performed best over 100 years, to what extent, and why?

Because commodities and bonds weren't available, there's not a direct way to back-test. What may be valuable instead is identifying the relationship to these types of assets to growth and inflation.
